# VIMANA-STEM-LIGHT
The LIGHT version works with the prior ESP12E/ESP12F or other ESP8266 controllers.
This project is a fork without the need of N76E003. The main features is to use the controls of the new app to control two motors and servos.
You can use the unused ports to controll additional servos (not yet implemented).
If you need more, feel free to contribute.
Thank you to Ravi for his work.

You will find the Anrdoid App in the folder Andorid.
